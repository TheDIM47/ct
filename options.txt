Properties
==========

  Repeatable - boolean 
  ----------
    If source or destination file locked for reading/writing by another
    application, D2D will try to reopen file after "MsecWait" milliseconds
    or after the OS event occurs. 

  MsecWait - long integer
  --------
    Wait for "MsecWait" milliseconds and make next try to open locked file.
    (See MSDN WaitForSingleObject function for details)

  DateSupport - boolean 
  -----------
    The Clarion 2.X DAT table does not contains real DATE type.
    Instead, dates and times stored in fields of type LONG.

    D2D will try to resolve DATE fields by field name
    using DateContains and/or DateStarted properties.

    This string properties should contains strings delimited by ";"

    For example, if DateContains property is "DATE;DOF" then fields of
    type LONG with field names _containing_ substring "DATE" or "DOF"
    ( for example "ACC:EXP_DATE" ) will be treat as DATE field.

    For DateStarted property, fields of type LONG with field names
    _beginning_ with required substring will be treat as DATE field.

    Values of DateStarted property processed before DateContains values.

  DateContains - string 
  ------------
    Holds strings, delimited by ";" which use for date resolution.
    If field (of type LONG !) name _contains_ any of present string,
    this field will treat as DATE field.

  DateStarted - string 
  -----------
    Holds strings, delimited by ";" which use for date resolution.
    If field (of type LONG) name _starts_ from any of present string,
    this field will treat as DATE field.

    Note 1: field prefix excluded from clarion field names;

    Note 2: You can easy convert Clarion date to windows date using
            simple algorythm:
                              WindowsDate := ClarionDate - 36161;

    Note 3: If you set DateSupport to True, you should also set
            DateStarted and/or DateContains property;

  AppendMode - boolean 
  ----------
    If destination table exists, converted records will be appended,
    overwhise new table will be (re-)created.

    Note: Be careful in shared environment !

  UnDelMode - boolean 
  ---------
    If True, Clarion records marked as deleted in Clarion table 
    will be "undeleted" and converted to destination dBase file.

  ArraySupport - boolean 
  ------------
    Clarion array fields will be converted to dBASE string (!),
    delimited by ";" char. String length calculated using
    adaptive algorythm. If "ArraySupport" false, only the first
    array elementh (<array>[1]) will be converted using appropriate
    field type.

  OemConvert - TOemCvtType
  ----------
    Strings, containing international characters will be converted
    using standard Windows procedures: 
      OemToCharBuff or CharToOemBuff  (see MSDN for details)
